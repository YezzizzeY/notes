**Bitcontracts: Supporting Smart Contracts in Legacy Blockchains** 

>**Background:** Smart contracts, popularized by systems like Ethereum, allow nearly  arbitrary business logic to be implemented without a trusted third party
>
>**Problem**:
>
>1. While the concept of smart contracts has shown great promise, many currently  popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin , Litecoin, Ripple or Stellar , do not natively support them. 
>2. Even if some of the existing platforms support contracts, the types of contracts  that can be implemented on these systems may be severely limited. For example,  Ethereum uses a Turing-complete programming language, but the complexity of  computations that can be implemented as contracts are very restricted, due to  the built-in block gas limit.
>
>**Solution**: a novel system called Bitcontracts —
>
>adds expressive smart contract execution capabilities to legacy cryptocurrencies  without requiring protocol changes to the legacy system, and overcomes the main  limitations of previous solutions.
>
>**Contribution**: off-chain execution model, where the contract’s issuers appoints a set of  service providers to execute the contract’s code.

**LaKSA: A Probabilistic Proof-of-Stake Protocol**

>**Background:** protocols for maintaining a distributed data structure called a blockchain
>
>**Problems:** 
>
>**Proof-of-Work**:  an enormous energy footprint, low throughput, and a slow and insecure block  commitment process that relies on the absence of large-scale adversarial  behavior; 
>
>Furthermore, its reward frequency and structure encourage centralization, which  in turn amplifies its security vulnerabilities
>
>**Proof-of-Stake**: a high reward variance which encourages centralization; it has proven challenging to replace PoW-based voting by cryptographic  primitives while avoiding fundamental limitations; it is easier to launch long-range attacks in the PoS setting
>
>**Contribution:**  a chain-based Proof-of-Stake protocol that is dedicated, but not limited, to  cryptocurrencies
>
>- minimizes interactions between nodes through lightweight committee voting
>- high reward variance and long confirmation times
>- support large numbers of nodes by design
>- provides probabilistic safety guarantees
>- can be applied more broadly to other  Proofof-Stake protocols (not limited to cryptocurrencies)

**[Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Vulnerable Does Not Imply Exploited](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/perez)**

>**Backround:** In recent years, we have seen a great deal of both academic and practical  interest in the topic of vulnerabilities in smart contracts, particularly those  developed for the Ethereum blockchain.

# Summary

### BlockChain

#### Security in different layer

Blockchain security has been studied in nearly every layer:

- P2P network: like RAP
- Payment channels: Generality - abandoning the limitations of scripts and specific signature algorithms
- Decentralized Applications:  Decentralized exchanges, and so on
- Consensus algorithm: POW POS BFT ... all need to be improved
- Smart Contract and EVM: Smart contract security, detection, defense, virtual machine optimization
- Blockchain system: Anonymity, fairness, efficiency, etc
- RPC: DOS attack...
- ...

#### Research Areas

The current academic interest in blockchain security can simply be divided into several types: 

1. Attack method

   The attack methods include DOS, exploiting the loopholes of block chain transaction rules, such as transaction delay, transaction priority strategy, and attacking the underlying P2P network. In order to discover these attacks, we need to know the detailed rules of a certain level of blockchain, then have some ideas, and use a lot of experiments to verify them.

   Generally, every system designed will have design flaws, which will be reflected in almost all systems, and the blockchain system is no exception.

2. Detection tools

   In the blockchain system, there are several kinds of things that many people participate in:

   nodes participating in the blockchain system, mining and other activities, maintaining the distributed system of the blockchain;

   DAPP providers not only participate in node maintenance, but also provide app like services; 

   Smart contracts published on blockchain ledger by users; 

   Users who want to use DAPP.

   In these areas, there will be a variety of attacks, the detection of a large number of attacks is very important for people to understand the security of blockchain and do subsequent maintenance measures. Detection means may include detection tools, survey of events that have occurred, etc

3. Defensive measures

   Defense means for specific attacks to defend, and through experiments to detect the effect of defense. Some defense means do not achieve perfect defense, but create a basic defense concept.

4. Anonymity in blockchain

   The transparency of blockchain may lead to privacy leakage, so the research on anonymity of identity, transaction and consensus algorithm on blockchain has always been a hot topic. The methods used include ring signature, zero knowledge proof, security protocol design for specific consensus algorithm and so on.

5. Find others' loopholes 

   Some people's proposed schemes may be wrong. When looking at other people's various implementation schemes, we may find the loopholes of other people's schemes according to our knowledge, and prove the problems of other people's schemes through in-depth analysis.

6. Improvements to existing schemes

   The design of each part of the existing blockchain system will be insufficient, the efficiency of each layer on the blockchain, the level of decentralization of the blockchain, the fairness of the blockchain consensus algorithm, and so on. I think it's great if we could achieve innovation in these filed. For instance, Payment channel like Lockable Signatures and Bitcoin-Compatible Virtual Channels, Contracts outside the chain, Anonymous blockchain like zcash and quisquis(Eurocrypt 2019).

#### Future direction

I am interested in almost everything about blockchain security. I have previously achieved a blockchain system that uses zero-knowledge proof to achieve supervisable on-chain transaction data privacy (transaction identity is not private).(https://github.com/xdlianrong208/MaskChain) 

In my perspective, zero-knowledge proof involves a lot of mathematical knowledge, and it is mainly divided into homomorphic encryption schemes and obfuscated circuits. First of all, I feel that the homomorphic encryption scheme, mostly referred to, the sigma protocol, is a bit difficult to innovate in the protocol design, which needs accumulation of mathematical knowledge. I am able to apply the existing sigma protocol, such as combining several sigma protocols to implement some goals. I am not very familiar with the underlying circuit of the confusion circuit. The main research direction of the current confusion circuit seems to include improving efficiency and applying the confusion circuit to other scenarios. Similar to zcash and tonadocash.
On the other hand, I am also willing to try aspects other than blockchain. Because a lot of knowledge is  interlinked, and the combination of blockchain and other technologies is also meaningful.

I think my knowledge of academic research has been superficial and scanty and want to find one or two topics for further study.
